Data sources currently required for running Selenzy that could be retrieved from biochem4j:

1. Currently from MetaNetX:

- Chemicals: name, inchi, id (metanetx)
- Reactions: stoichiometric equation based on chemical ids

2. Currently from Metacyc and rhea:

- Enzyme sequences associated with reactions, uniprot id, description, organism id (ncbi taxonomy), confidence score of annotation for each associated reaction

3. Pre/post-processing:

- Reaction consensus direction: knowledge-based consensus direction based on chemical transformations (in-house algorithm
- Chemical fingerprints. Currently they are precomputed and stored in a python object. Potentially they could be stored in biochem4j.
- Phylogenetic distance between chassis and organism sources for each sequence.

4. Thermodynamics and kinetics:

- Reaction Gibbs free energy (experimental/predicted from Metacyc).
- Substrate KM (experimental from Brenda and Uniprot/predicted).
- Turnover rate kcat (experimental from Brenda and Uniprot/predicted).
